## Usage

To use the app run
```
ruby app.rb
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:4567. Once the page loads you can either start with adding bands or venues to your lists. From there you can add additional bands or update the name of the band should you have an error. You can also delete the entry if you change your mind. Once you create venues and band names you can then add them to each other. For example, add bands to a venue you created so you can see which bands are going to that venue.
